A SIMPLE CALCULATOR BY USING PYTHON
In this project I had created a calculator dealing with Arithmetic operations but it's beyond just promting the user to enter two operands and one operation.
User can enter expressions like this as well: **8+9*2/3%2**
I had used **Tkniter** Library for Graphical User Interface
